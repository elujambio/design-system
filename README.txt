Design System is a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript components
which are meant to be reused across a range of platforms, services, 
and projects.

This is a basic barebones project, but will serve to define a basic,  
but functional design language for dashboards, panels, forms, 
etcetera. 

The project consists of components which are separated in folders with 
their respective HTML, SCSS, JS files.

The point is to manage dependencies manually inside Rails projects by calling the necessary SCSS and JS files with the asset pipeline.
